Been away for a bit and I need to contribute once again to my own education (of which this was to be a part - the documentation at least).

## Life Takes a Toll

I've let too many side-projects into my life, went a bit mad with the stress of that, and have found myself shirking a lot of duties in my life.  Recently had a moment of clarity and have re-aligned on priorities in my life.  I think I'm ready to begin here again...time will tell.

Things rarely go to plan and I, for one, have been terrible at execution.
