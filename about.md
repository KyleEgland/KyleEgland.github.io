## Who is Kyle

It should be noted that any given person is anything but one thing. We are all people and wear many hats and, like most matter, really only measurable in our given state. I am a father and husband above all - though, side note, I don't necessarily prescribe to those as "gendered" norms but rather, I have no other framework by which to quickly reference to you what my most valued relationships are otherwise. I enjoy learning and continuous improvement - I love learning something new and then applying it to something else. I have had ample opportunity over the last few years to learn a great deal about software development (defining user needs through post-market sustainment, maintenance, and security incidence response) and hope to capture some of it for reference my [Github](https://github.com/KyleEgland). This page is included to give you some context and background for the things that are in here as I'm not a software developer by trade. My work for paid employers is not available here and I am not one to steel so I'm affraid that code will remain their secret. The concepts I've learned, the skills I've mastered, and the mental framework I've gained from those experiences I will continue to carry with me.

Time is a devil that will eventually nab us all but, when I have time, I will be applying what I've learned to past personal projects in an effort to show my growth and continue to apply myself and learn. This (software development) is something that I greatly desire to do more of whether creating tools for proof-of-concept security tests or linking antiquated systems through a custom built API to ensure that the business can continue to function. Life is full of unique oportunities and challenges that can be met with a little ingenuity and the right people working together with you.
