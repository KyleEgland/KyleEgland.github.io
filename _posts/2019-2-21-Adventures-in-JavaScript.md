# The Journey's Beginning
...or...My foray into **web application** development

### Ulterior Motives
Part of my day job is data analysis, for which I'd like to institute the use of some Python programming to make things easier (not a fan of Excel, like, at all...). I love programming in Python (just check out my [repos](https://github.com/KyleEgland?tab=repositories)). It occurred to me, however, that no one is going to install Python, then my program, then learn how to run it and whatever else it may entail. People are resistant to changes that are minor let alone learning something that resembles code (I.e. running something from the command line). The safety and comfort of a GUI would be what they'll always prefer. So, I started writing that and packaging it as an exe. That too comes with some draw backs - how do we do updates and maintain security and...that was scrapped quickly.

### A New Angle
I've therefore decided that the best solution would be to put my idea into a web application, brilliant!...right? Problem is I know Python and not the full-stack necessary to run a responsive and secure web application. I know Python, how hard could it possibly be to write, run, and maintain a Django application?! Well, it turns out there are some downfalls to running a Django app as well:

  - You get _e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g_ with Django:
    * All the bells and whistles - even the ones you don't use
    * Any existing bugs - even in things you don't use...

You get the picture. So I looked into this whole framework-less or no framework movement or thing, whatever. It seemed really cool and pure - I really dug it! Problem is, I write Python. After some searching, came across [this](https://youtu.be/JaMCxVWtW58) video, followed it, and came up with [this](https://kyleegland.github.io/no_framework_web_app).

Please feel free to check out the work, copy it, fork it, what have you.  Please check out the [originator](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA) of the content and give them some views - it's not me (the channel), I can't support them monetarily so I figured the _least_ I could do is direct people their way in the hopes of getting them some more views.

Also, thanks for stopping by, I really appreciate it.

Respectfully,

Kyle
