## Re-aligning Expectations

The original intentions of this blog were to be a regular posting of my learning - continuous feed of useful tid-bits of technology information that may be useful to others. Moreover, they would serve as public evidence of my work and capability. Most of my work, though, has been proprietary and I have been unable to apply the learnings from those endeavours to public repositories. Not having the time to create a "pretty" project has left this blog with a lack of content and so, once again, I create another entry in an effort to improve myself by doing something.

This blog will now serve as my landing page, mainly. I will be contributing posts here every now and then but they will probably be more geared toward personal reflection and growth. I wanted to be like the many content creators that I've spent so many hours learning from by providing content here. Instead, the references in my projects and the efforts I put into documenation will have to do the teaching. I'm quite a ways off from being an expert (though I love learning so I quite enjoy the journey) so my expectations were (probably) more than lofty.

I'm also striving for brevity now (no one wants to read a long-winded post); thank you for visiting, thank you for reading.

Be nice,

Kyle
