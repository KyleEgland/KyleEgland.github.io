# Kyle Egland Developer Landing Page
This page was made by forking [this](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) repository.  Please see the credits section of this file for further attribution - takes a village to raise a child and a community to create a developer.

## Synopsis
Every developer should have a site for themselves in which to display some of their work - this is mine.  This project utilizes [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to serve the site.

## Local Development
Serving the site locally requires a Ruby environment and the Jekyll package.  See the credits below for links to installation resources.

Serve the blog locally:

`$ exec jekyll serve`

### Style changes
Modify the file `style.scss` in the root.
