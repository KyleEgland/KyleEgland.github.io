# KyleEgland.github.io

My (Kyle Egland's) landing page made with Jekyll, stored in GitHub, and served by Pages.

## Synopsis

This project is my developer landing page; it was originally forked from [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). This is a project to learn from (e.g. setting up a local Ruby development environment) as well as a documentation of personal growth.

## Credits

This page was made by forking [this](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) repository.  Additionally, original attribution from that repository is listed below.
