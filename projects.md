# Kyle's Github Projects

History, should be studied so we may learn from it. All of my publicly viewable projects are availbable on my [Github](https://github.com/KyleEgland). I have made attempt to "clean-up" my account (removing derelict projects, etc.) and have since resolved that it would be better to appropriately update the projects instead. The below projects are ones that may be of some interest for either learning purposes or examples of the code that I have created.

## Python

[tkinterguiexample](https://github.com/KyleEgland/tkinterguiexample)
- A simple GUI using tkinter and Python

[py_pdf_splitter](https://github.com/KyleEgland/py_pdf_splitter)
- A GUI application that splits PDF files written with Python

## Flask

Yes, this is still Python and web applications :)

[Submit Multiple Forms]("https://github.com/KyleEgland/flask_multi-form_submit")
- Flask (Python) web app project
