  <h1>127.0.0.1</h1>
  <p>A constant, eager learner with the "<a href="https://hak5.org">technolust</a>", experience in the medical device industry, military leadership (Marine Corps), and cyber (network/application/device/infrastructure) security.</p>
  <h2>Strengths</h2>
  <ul>

    <li>Relator</li>
    <li>Learner</li>
    <li>Futuristic</li>
    <li>Intellection</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The <a>Gallop Strengths</a> offer a quick overview of my personality - I love to learn about new things (learner) and think about ways in which we can collectively do things better (intellection, futuristic) driven by the passion of those around me (competition) to be achieve and be apart of the team (relator).</p>
  <p>Thank you for visiting my landing page :)</p>
